# MsShellcodeDev
The Solution to help Developing &amp; Debugging as C &amp; Deploying in Shellcode.

To build the projects, please install Visual Studio 2026 (as slnx not compatible with older version) with C++ Desktop components & Windows XP support feature (though depreciated, but needed to make output files could be tested on windows xp) installed.

The "VcxprojToShellcodeCompiler.exe" in the "Release" could be used to generate pure vc project (no c++, no global variables) into shelcode binary files using Visual Studio 2015 or newer version of MS Dev IDE.
